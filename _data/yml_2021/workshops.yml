  description: Have you wanted to use APIs to gather data, but arenâ€™t quite sure where to start?  This is the workshop for you.  During this 60 minute workshop, we will cover the basic functionality and terminology of APIs while walking through three examples.  We will also describe and share resources available to help you use them.  We will demonstrate that APIs are not as big, scary, and inaccessible as they might originally seem.

  description: "A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results."
