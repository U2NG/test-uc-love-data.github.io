  time:  11 am - noon
  description: Have you wanted to use APIs to gather data, but arenâ€™t quite sure where to start?  This is the workshop for you.  During this 60 minute workshop, we will cover the basic functionality and terminology of APIs while walking through three examples.  We will also describe and share resources available to help you use them.  We will demonstrate that APIs are not as big, scary, and inaccessible as they might originally seem.

It is also straightforward enough that you can learn enough to start doing basic analysis in only an hour! No programming experience is necessary, but you will need access to a keyboard and microphone for this interactive session."

  description: "A map in a GIS (geographic information system) may dazzle us with its visual appeal and complexity, but if the data it contains is out-of-date, offset, incomplete, or too generalized, how useful is it? <br><br>In this workshop you will learn what to look out for while discovering and managing GIS data. Topics include key parameters of geospatial data, acquiring data, file formats, and including tabular data in a GIS."

  day:  t
  time:   1 - 2 pm
  description:  Interested in learning where to look for historical, cultural, or other kinds of humanities datasets? This workshop will share resources for discovering textual, visual, spatial, and social network data of use to students and scholars across humanities disciplines. We will also look at a variety of digital tools and methodologies that humanities researchers are using to computationally answer research questions and generate new ones. Whether you are new to Digital Humanities or have been engaged in digital research or teaching for years, join us to share your questions and connect with other UCR community members interested in DH.

  day: t
  time: 2 - 3 pm
  description: "A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results."
