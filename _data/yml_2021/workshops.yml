  time:  11 am - Noon
  description: Have you wanted to use APIs to gather data, but aren’t quite sure where to start?  This is the workshop for you.  During this 60 minute workshop, we will cover the basic functionality and terminology of APIs while walking through three examples.  We will also describe and share resources available to help you use them.  We will demonstrate that APIs are not as big, scary, and inaccessible as they might originally seem.

  time:   10:00 am - Noon
  description:  This workshop covers an introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and caveats for its application to health data. Using the R programming language we will introduce the basics of text processing and demo how to calculate common metrics including word frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore important words and group similar documents. We will also introduce more advanced NLP topics (sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.) and discuss classical versus deep learning approaches, as time permits. Learners with proficient R skills are encouraged to code along.

  description:  This workshop will unpack the subjective process of data visualization and its relationship to concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion. We'll critically explore how data can be used to uphold and perpetuate, or quantify and demonstrate structural oppression. Through this workshop learners will practice the technique of "data visceralization," the process of experiencing differences in data and understanding them viscerally. This workshop is led by UC Davis DataLab's Data Feminism research and learning cluster, which focuses on thinking about data science and data ethics as informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.
